Here are the files for microscopy analysis: 
  - Fiji Macro
  - Input folder (zipped, unzip to extract data prior to use)
  - Output folder (zipped, unzip to extract data prior to use)

Please look at the details and directions in the macro for more information.

*Note that the input and output folders contain only a few stacks as examples for images due to the large size. "Results.xlsx" file contains instead the analysis of all samples. Contact the corresponding author for access to all the image stacks.*
